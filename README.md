# N-Queens-Problem
N Queens problem solving algorithm using backtracking written in Python

## About the problem:
N Queens problem is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## About the script:
* This Python script displays all possible solutions for N-size board, it print the board using numpy matrix. if numpy library is not installed, regular list printing is performed.

* You can change the size of the board by passing an integer to the script:
~~~
$ python3 NQueensProblem.py 8
~~~

* If no arguments passed, the sciprt creates a 4x4 board and tries to solve it.
* The script also display how much time did it take to calculate and print the solutions

* Example of the output ( using numpy matrix ):
~~~
$ python3 NQueensProblem.py 4
